# apache-subdomain-creator
I was working on a project and we needed to create subdomain automaticlly so i created this simple bash script for it.

We were using cwp as our server controll panel so the apache config files paths are a bit different than their usual path...

Also if you have a wild card ssl certification installed on your server you can uncomment the specified lines in the scripts.
By doing that the subdomains will have ssl cetrificate installed on them.
